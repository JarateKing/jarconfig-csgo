# Jarconfig CSGO

A config for CSGO.

## Install

1. Download or `git clone` this repo
2. Unzip/clone into your csgo install's `cfg` folder. If you downloaded from zip, rename from `jarconfig-csgo-master` to `jarconfig-csgo`. The folder directory should look like `csgo/cfg/jarconfig-csgo/`.
3. add `+exec jarconfig-csgo/run.cfg` to your launch options \*
4. edit and customize `jarconfig-csgo/settings.cfg`

\* Unlike most other csgo cfg's, we don't use `host_writeconfig` because there is some setup that must always be performed inside the other cfg's. Because of this, we will have to keep `+exec jarconfig-csgo/run.cfg` inside the launch options.

## Features

* Simple to use settings that ease cfg creation
* Additional bind functions and cfg's that make customizing easy
* No forced binds
